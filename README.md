# Fork & Spoon - A fun, social food-sharing app

## Vision
Fork & Spoon is a social recipe-sharing web application that allows users to create, share, and discover new recipes. 
My goal is to connect food lovers, promote home cooking, and simplify meal planning.

## Functional Requirements (What the system will do)
*	User registration and login
*	Profile page with user info, favorite recipes, uploaded recipes
*	Add, edit, and delete personal recipes, upload photo
*	Browse recipes by category (e.g., Vegan, Desserts, etc.)
*	Browse recipes by ingredient
*	Save favorite recipes
*	Search and filter recipes

## Non-Functional Requirements (System properties & constraints)
* The application should be responsive (work on desktop & mobile)
* The backend should handle at least 1,000 users
* Recipe images should load quickly (optimized images)
* Authentication should be secure (hashed passwords)

## MoSCoW Prioritization
*(Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have for now)*
* Must-have: User authentication, recipe CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), search/filter
* Should-have: Categories, favorites
* Could-have: Meal planner, ingredient substitution suggestions, log in with google account
* Won’t-have (for now): Video recipes, AI-based recommendations

*This is the repo for the frontend of the project*
